<h2>With BINK, you can track exactly which links people click on your bio, sell your products straight from your page, add YouTube videos, music, and even photos—all in one place.</h2>

Beat 4 (your story angle):
<h2> “For the next 30 days, I’ll post daily—tracking how many users join, even if it’s zero. You’ll see everything.</h2>

Beat 5 (hype & hook):
<h2>“also I’m not just posting videos—I’ll be DM’ing people, sharing responses, and even begging y’all to tag them until they notice me. They say success takes shamelessness… well, I want to succeed too.”</h2>

Call-to-action (last frame):
<h2>“Join BINK through the link in my bio. And hey—drop a comment if you have a suggestion also plz repost. 👇”</h2>
